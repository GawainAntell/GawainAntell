ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Dr Gwen Antell, a paleobiologist and ecologist. You can look up my full CV as a repository, https://github.com/GwenAntell/CV.

The other repos here use marine fossil distributions to explore macroecology and evolution at a range of spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. Using empirical data to address research questions in this area frequently means I need to develop new methods and/or new implementations of existing methodological theory for spatiotemporal statistics. My first methods package is `kerneval` (https://github.com/GwenAntell/kerneval), which constructs kernel density estimates while accounting for sampling bias. `divvy` (https://github.com/GwenAntell/divvy) is my new R package offering various ways to spatially-standardize the fossil record for biogeographic and biodiversity studies. Stay tuned, and let me know if you're interested in beta testing!

The best way to reach me is at my current institutional email, gwen.antell@ucr.edu ðŸ“«
